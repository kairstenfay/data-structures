# Data Structures

Common computer science data structures.
Each data structure can be printed by calling `print()` on the object.

## Linked List
The LinkedList implementation has the following methods:
* `length()`
* `insert(x, i)`
* `reverse()`
* `index(x)`
* `push()`
* `pop()`
* `remove(x)`
* `count(x)`

## Binary Tree
The BinaryTree implementation has the following methods:
* `depth()`
* `insert(x)`
