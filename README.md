# Data Structures

Common computer science data structures.

Each is implemented with the following API:

* `length()`
* `push()`
* `pop()`
* `insert(x, i)`
* `remove(x)`
* `index(x)`
* `count(x)`

Each data structure can be printed by calling `print()` on the object.

**Linked List**
In addition to the API shared across all data structures, the LinkedList implementation has the following methods:
* `reverse()`
